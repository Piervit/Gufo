Welcome to Gufo's documentation!
================================

Gufo is a modern shell programming language.
It is in alpha stage!

I would say that the main goal is to raise interest and propositions over a new
better shell for the linux operating system. Gufo tries to be innovative.

For now, Gufo is developped as an hobby by a simple modest human. Help from
experimented person is very welcome. Opinion from language researcher also is
welcome.
